## Usage

### Running the Full Pipeline

#### Via CLI (recommended)

Run the pipeline from the repository root with a configuration file (JSON or YAML):

```cmd
python -m celios.cli run --config path\to\config.yaml --verbose
```

Options:
- `--config` (required): Path to pipeline config (JSON or YAML)
- `--verbose`: Print detailed output
- `--plan`: Only print execution plan without running
- `--stop-after`: Stop execution after a specific step

#### Via Python Script

Alternatively, define the configuration directly in a Python script and call `run_celios()`:

```python
from celios.core import run_celios

config = {
    "paths": {
        "base": ".",
        "input": "data",
        "output": "results",
        "cellfiles_dir": "results/cell_lines",
    },
    "steps": {
        "Node": {
            "node_input": "node_dic_input/DNAdamage.sif",
            "hgnc_symbols_file": "node_dic_input/hgnc_complete_set.txt",
            "manual_symbols_file": "node_dic_input/manual_symbols.csv",
            "include_alias_previous_symbols": False,
            "directory_output": "results",
        },
        "Activity": {
            "activity_file": "activity_input/rnaseq_tpm_20220624.csv",
            "cell_line_file": "activity_input/cell_line_list.csv",
            "tf_activity_file": "activity_input/ccle_tf_activities.csv",
            "mutations_file": "activity_input/CCLE_muts_binary.csv",
            "cnv_file": "activity_input/CCLE_CNV_binary.csv",
            "directory_output": "results",
            "data_sources": ["mutations", "cnv", "TF"],
        },
    },
}

artifacts = run_celios(config=config, plan=False, verbose=True)
```

See `tests/test_run_celios.py` and `tests/celios_consensus.py` for additional examples.

### Tissue-Organized Output (Optional)

CELIOS supports organizing DrugLogics training files by tissue type. When `paths.tissue_dir` is specified, training files are written to `tissue_dir/<Tissue>/<cell_line_name>/` based on the tissue information in `cell_line_file`.

This is useful when:
- You have cell lines from multiple tissues and want organized output
- Existing tissue folders contain additional files (they will be preserved)
- You want to create new tissue/cell-line directories automatically

Example config:
```yaml
paths:
  tissue_dir: "results/tissue_folders"  # Enable tissue-organized output
steps:
  Activity:
    cell_line_file: "data/cell_line_list.csv"  # Must contain 'tissue', 'SIDM', and 'cell_line_name' columns
```

The CSV file must include columns for tissue, SIDM (unique identifier), and cell_line_name (folder names) when using tissue-organized output. For legacy mode (`cellfiles_dir`), no specific columns are required.

### Skipping the Node Step (Using Pre-built Node Dictionary)

If you already have a pre-built node dictionary file, you can skip **STEP 1 (Node dictionary generation)** by:

1. **Omitting** the `"Node"` section from `steps` in your config
2. **Adding** `"node_dic"` to the `Activity` section pointing to your CSV file

Example:

```python
config = {
    "paths": {
        "base": ".",
        "input": "consensus",
        "output": "consensus/hgsoc_results",
    },
    "steps": {
        "Activity": {
            "node_dic": "hgsoc_net/NODE_HGNC_equivalences.csv",  # Pre-built node dictionary
            "activity_file": "activity_input/rnaseq_tpm_20220624.csv",
            "cell_line_file": "activity_input/cell_line_list.csv",
            "tf_activity_file": "activity_input/ccle_tf_activities.csv",
            "mutations_file": "activity_input/CCLE_muts_binary.csv",
            "cnv_file": "activity_input/CCLE_CNV_binary.csv",
            "directory_output": "consensus/hgsoc_results",
            "data_sources": ["mutations", "cnv", "TF"],
        },
    },
}

artifacts = run_celios(config=config, verbose=True)
```

The pipeline will:
- **Skip STEP 1** (Node dictionary generation) since `"Node"` is not defined
- Load your CSV file as the node dictionary
- Proceed to **STEP 2** (Activity extraction)

Your CSV file should have at least two columns:
- First column: node names
- Second column: symbols (comma-separated list of gene symbols)

See `tests/celios_hgsoc.py` for a real example using a pre-built node dictionary.

### Pipeline Behavior

**Scenario 1: `"Node"` step is defined in config**
- STEP 1 will run (Node dictionary generation), even if `node_dic` is also in Activity
- The generated node dictionary will be used for Activity extraction

**Scenario 2: `"Node"` step is NOT defined, but `node_dic` is in Activity config**
- STEP 1 is skipped
- The provided CSV file is loaded and used directly

**Scenario 3: Neither `"Node"` step nor `node_dic` is provided**
- The pipeline will raise an error (no node dictionary source available)

### Feature Helpers

Call Node helpers directly with CLI subcommands:

```cmd
python -m celios.cli node-from-sif --sif examples\DNAdamage.sif --hgnc examples\hgnc_complete_set.txt --out results\node_dict.csv

python -m celios.cli node-from-object --input "TP53,BRCA1,EGFR" --hgnc examples\hgnc_complete_set.txt --out results\node_dict.csv --include_alias_prev
```

## Installation

### Quick Install

For a quick setup with minimal steps:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

For detailed installation instructions, troubleshooting, and virtual environment setup, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

### Run from Source

Alternatively, run CLI commands from the repository root without installing:

```Architecture & Design

### Pipeline Overview

CELIOS is a two-step pipeline:

1. **Node Extraction** - Extract nodes from a biological network (SIF format) and map them to standardized gene symbols (HGNC)
2. **Activity Calculation** - Integrate multi-omics data (mutations, CNV, TF activity, gene expression) into activity matrices by cell line

Each step can be skipped or customized via configuration.

### Configuration-Driven Design

The pipeline is entirely controlled via JSON or YAML configuration files, making it easy to:
- Define data sources and output locations
- Skip pipeline steps
- Reproduce analyses
- Scale to multiple datasets

See [PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) for detailed code organization and module descriptions.

## Notes

- **YAML support** - YAML config files require `pyyaml` in your environment (optional). JSON configs work without extra packages.
  ```bash
  pip install pyyaml
  ```
- **Example configurations** - See `tests/test_run_celios.py`, `tests/celios_consensus.py`, and `tests/celios_hgsoc.py` for real-world examples
- **Interactive tutorials** - See `notebooks/1_select_visualize.ipynb` for a step-by-step walkthrough
- **Project structure** - See [PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) for code organization
This works as long as you're in the repository directory.

## Notes

- YAML config support in the CLI requires `pyyaml` in your environment (optional). JSON configs work without extra packages.
- See `tests/test_run_celios.py`, `tests/celios_consensus.py`, and `tests/celios_hgsoc.py` for example configurations and usage patterns.
